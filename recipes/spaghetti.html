           <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Red onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Dried oregano</li>
            <li>Canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
           </ul>
           <h4>Steps:</h4>
           <ol>
            <li>First, set a heavy-bottomed 6-quart sauce pot over medium heat. Add the butter
                and onions, and stir until the onions become soft. If they start to brown, turn 
                the heat down to medium-low.
            </li>
                <li>Then stir in the minced garlic and saute for another couple of minutes. 
                    Next add in the ground sausage, ground beef, and dried oregano. Cook the 
                    meat and break it into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Once the meat 
                    pieces are well browned, stir in the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes.
                </li>
                <li>Cover and simmer for 30-60 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>Once the sauce is done, stir in the fresh chopped basil. Taste, then salt 
                    and pepper as needed. If the meat sauce tastes too acidic, stir in 1-2 
                    tablespoons sugar.
                </li>
           </ol>
